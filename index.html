                                    This approach is more commonly used if the app you’re designing requires complex
                                    business logic.</p>

                        <p>
                              Power Apps leverages the Common Data Service (CDS) which uses a role-based security
                              model.
                              For users, this means that security roles can be established using a certain set of
                              access
                              permissions, ensuring that employees only see the data appropriate for their job
                              role.

                              When businesses first start using Power Apps, there can be concerns about user
                              access and
                              restricting certain information within an app. However, Microsoft have implemented
                              functionality to ensure that the apps are secure, and privileges can be granted
                              where
                              necessary.
